ORFID Development Notes:

Start/Stop Function that Hugo wanted to create:
- Files don't actually have "reader started" data in the messages

export_ORFID 
- Is this function necessary or should we delete it?

Old import function needs testing and an example

Marker_tag and marker_tag_plot
- What is the purpose of these functions?

Are the example data working? 
- Need to add a second dataset that can be used to demonstrate the directional functions
