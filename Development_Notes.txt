ORFID Development Notes:

Import:
- It would be nice if the function produced an error if you told it there would be delims but there wasn't. I ran into this function during batch imports.
- Parsing warning is from files that start with rows with fewer columns than the detection data
- Incomplete last line happens for every file because there isn't a blank line on the file

Import Events:
-Function doesn't work without SCD and even when SCD is present it's not populating propery. I fixed this but we just need to merge it.

Join:
- This should only keep distinct rows in case there were duplicate downloads

Tag Summary:
- Why are there two?

Start/Stop Function:
- Files don't actually have "reader started" data
