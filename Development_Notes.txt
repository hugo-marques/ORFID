ORFID Development Notes:

Start/Stop Function that Hugo wanted to create:
- Files don't actually have "reader started" data in the messages

export_ORFID 
- Is this function necessary or should we delete it?

site_summary
- why do we care what the last tag detected was?

Vignette:
- Need to create

Old import function needs testing and an example

Marger tag summary and plot needs testing

Are the example data working? 
- There are two data folders in the package
- Need to change the examples that I've used to match with Hugo's example data frames, so that the user can use all the functions with the example data.
