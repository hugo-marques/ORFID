ORFID Development Notes:

Start/Stop Function that Hugo wanted to create:
- Files don't actually have "reader started" data in the messages, so I don't think this function will work

export_ORFID 
- Is this function necessary?
- I don't see the utility and I think we should delete it

Old import function needs testing and an example
- I don't have a lot of old data that are delimited, so it would be great if Hugo could test this and create an example

Marker_tag and marker_tag_plot
- What is the purpose of these functions? 
- Particularly the marker_tag function. 
- I think the pupose is probably in 'gap' but I don't quite understand it, so it would be good if Hugo could update the details with a better description of gap

Are the example data working? 
- Need to add a second dataset that can be used to demonstrate the directional functions
- Need to make sure all of the examples are working with the example data

Need to test
