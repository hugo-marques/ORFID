# ORFID
PIT telemetry produces large volumes of data, and it is challenging to process and summarize these data for further analysis. The ORFID R package automates and standardizes the import of raw data recorded by the new generation of Oregon RFID readers. Once data are imported, ORFID provides additional functions to combine data into multi-reader arrays, summarize tag and reader detections, determine tag direction, and calculate antenna efficiency. The compiled data can easily be exported as text or excel files for use within the userâ€™s preferred software analysis program. The ORFID package makes data compilation fast and efficient, increasing the power and accuracy of PIT telemetry studies.
