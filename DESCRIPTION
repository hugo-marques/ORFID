Title: Functions to manage, and summarize PIT data from Oregon RFID ORSR and ORMR readers
Description: Biotelemetry produces a large amount of data, especially PIT telemetry. Thus, 
    it is important to consider how to process the continual flow of data produced by 
    the PIT readers. The ORFID package is designed to automate and standardize the import 
    process of raw data recorded by the new generation of the Oregon RFID readers and 
    implements functions to gather data from multiple readers in one database, managing and 
    summarizing data. This helps to process and tidy the data tidy for posterior statistical 
    analysis. Future versions will implement functions for querying and automating fast 
    graphical analysis.
