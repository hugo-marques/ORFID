Title: Functions to manage and summarize data from Oregon RFID ORSR and ORMR readers
Description: PIT telemetry produces a large amount of data. Thus, it is important 
    to consider how to process the continual flow of data produced by the PIT 
    readers. The ORFID package is designed to automate and standardize the import 
    process of raw data recorded by the new generation of the Oregon RFID readers 
    and implements functions to gather data from multiple readers in one database,
    managing and summarizing data. This helps to process and tidy the data tidy 
    for posterior statistical analysis. Future versions will implement functions
    for querying and automating fast graphical analysis.
