## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
  Found the following files/directories:
    'bit' 'ggplot2' 'stringr' 'vctrs'
    
    This note appears sometimes and not others and it's not clear why it is happening. All examples use \dontrun, but perhaps there is a mistake or poorly executed portion of the package generating this note.
    
## Downstream dependencies

The packages in Depends, Imports, and Suggests are all CRAN packages that don't need to be checked?
